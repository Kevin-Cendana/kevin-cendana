<!-- Project: Chunkify -->
<h3><a href="https://github.com/Kevin-Cendana/Chunkify">Chunkify</a> <br>[In Development]</h3>
<p>Chunkify is a task list app with a twist: AI helps give advice and break down your tasks into smaller chunks! Chunkify is targeted towards people who get overwhelmed easily, such as people with ADHD, anxiety, or adjacent disorders. With this in mind, I have designed Chunkify's UI to be as clean, simple, and quick to use as possible.
<br>
<br>
Made for the <a href="https://lu.ma/o2sau79c">AI Hackathon @ CSUS</a> in April 2024 with a team of 4, but development is still ongoing. I made the UI as well as most of the frontend code. One of my passion projects that I still work on long term.</p>

<!-- Project: Byte Sized Projects -->
<h3><a href="">Byte Sized Projects</a></h3>
<p>I am a firm believer that the best way to learn is by doing. I like to make a lot of smaller apps in my free time just to get some practice or to try out a new field of programming for fun!
For example, here are a series of apps I made using Swift UI, including a sleep tracker, time converter, tip calculator, Word Scrabble, Guess the Flag. I made these apps to practice Swift UI and iOS development.</p>
