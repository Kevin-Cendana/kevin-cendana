| ![Portfolio Website](./portfolio-website.png) | **[Portfolio Website](https://kevinpcendana.com/)**<br>My personal portfolio website that showcases my projects, skills, and experiences. <br><br> I designed a template of the app with Figma and developed it from scratch with React. |

| ![Chunkify](./chunkify.png) | **[Chunkify](https://github.com/Kevin-Cendana/Chunkify)**<br>Chunkify is a task list with a twist: AI breaks down your tasks into smaller chunks. Chunkify is perfect for those who get overwhelmed easily, such as those with ADHD. <br><br>Made for the [AI Hackathon @ CSUS](https://lu.ma/o2sau79c) in April 2024 with a team of 4, but development is still ongoing. I made the UI & most of the frontend code. |

| ![AT&T 5G Website](./att-website.png) | **[AT&T 5G Technology Website](https://github.com/Kevin-Cendana/Hackathon-ATT-EmpowHer)**<br>A website that showcases the benefits of AT&T's 5G technology, such as faster speeds, lower latency, and more. <br><br>Made for [AT&T's Hackathon: EmpowHer](https://life.att.jobs/college-students-empowher-hackathon/) in June 2023. I designed and developed the website from scratch with HTML, JS, and CSS on my own. |

| ![Lyric Link](./lyric-link.gif) | **[Lyric Link](https://github.com/Kevin-Cendana/Hackathon-SacHacks-2023)**<br>A demo application using Django, React, HTML & CSS, Lyric Link acts as a forum that sorts through Top 100 songs on Billboard. <br><br>Made for [SacHacks](https://sachacks-v.devpost.com/) in November 2023 in a team of 4 over the weekend. I designed all of the UI, created all of the frontend code, and successfully linked with my teammates' Python backend code. |

| ![Maplestory App](./maplestory-app.gif) | **[Maplestory Mini](https://github.com/Kevin-Cendana/Byte-Sized-Projects/tree/main/Maplestory%20App)**<br>A project based on the gameplay loop of one of my favorite childhood games, Maplestory. <br><br>I made the app for fun to try out mobile development and familiarize myself with Flutter & Dart. |

| **[Byte Sized Projects](https://github.com/Kevin-Cendana/Byte-Sized-Projects)**<br>I am a firm believer that the best way to learn is by doing. As such, I like to make a lot of smaller apps in my free time just to get some practice or to try out a new field of programming for fun! <br><br>As an example, here are a series of apps I made using Swift UI, including a sleep tracker, time converter, tip calculator, Word Scrabble, Guess the Flag, & more. I made these apps to practice Swift UI and iOS development.
