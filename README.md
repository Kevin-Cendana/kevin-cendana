Thank you for giving my profile a visit!

<!-- Section: About Me -->
## ‚úçÔ∏è About Me
Whether it's for my career or my hobby, I love programming. I've always been drawn to the puzzle solving aspect and the challenges that come with it, as well as the satisfaction of seeing my creations come to life from designs.

<!-- Project: Chunkify -->
### [Chunkify](https://github.com/Kevin-Cendana/Chunkify)  
[In Development]  
Chunkify is a task list app with a twist: AI helps give advice and break down your tasks into smaller chunks! Chunkify is targeted towards people who get overwhelmed easily, such as people with ADHD, anxiety, or adjacent disorders. With this in mind, I have designed Chunkify's UI to be as clean, simple, and quick to use as possible.  
Made for the [AI Hackathon @ CSUS](https://lu.ma/o2sau79c) in April 2024 with a team of 4, but development is still ongoing. I made the UI as well as most of the frontend code.

A website that showcases the benefits of AT&T's 5G technology, such as faster speeds, lower latency, and more.

<!-- Project: Lyric Link -->
### [Lyric Link](https://github.com/Kevin-Cendana/Hackathon-SacHacks-2023)

A full stack demo application using Django, React, HTML & CSS, Lyric Link acts as a forum that sorts through the top 100 songs on Billboard. Users can leave thoughts and comments on the songs.  
Made for [SacHacks](https://sachacks-v.devpost.com/) in November 2023 in a team of 4 over the weekend. I designed the UI, created all of the frontend code, and successfully linked with my teammates' backend code.

<!-- Project: Maplestory Mini -->
### [Maplestory Mini](https://github.com/Kevin-Cendana/Byte-Sized-Projects/tree/main/Maplestory%20App)
![Maplestory App](./maplestory-app.gif)  
A project made to practice Flutter & Dart based on the gameplay loop of one of my favorite childhood games, Maplestory. I made the app for fun to try out mobile development!

<!-- Project: Byte Sized Projects -->
### Byte Sized Projects
I am a firm believer that the best way to learn is by doing. I like to make a lot of smaller apps in my free time just to get some practice or to try out a new field of programming for fun! For example, here are a series of apps I made using Swift UI, including a sleep tracker, time converter, tip calculator, Word Scrabble, Guess the Flag. I made these apps to practice Swift UI and iOS development.
